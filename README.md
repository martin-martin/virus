# virus

for actually making the `click_me` file into a virus, you can change the file name of that executable to `virus`.
then it keeps opening itself up and appending to that same file...

## convo

the other executable, `convo` encodes a [low-level programmer joke](https://qr.ae/TUfJMq) into spoken voice using `say`.
it's not very funny, just so you know.
